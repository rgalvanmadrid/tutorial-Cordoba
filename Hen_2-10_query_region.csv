Gim, Hansung B.","Costa, Allison H.; Johnson, Kelsey E.; Indebetouw, Remy; Finn, Molly K.; Brogan, Crystal L.; Reines, Amy Gim, Hansung B.; Reines, Amy E.","Henize 2-10 (He 2-10) is a nearby (D = 9 Mpc) starbursting blue compact dwarf galaxy that boasts a high star formation rate and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. He 2-10 is also one of the first galaxies in which embedded super star clusters (SSCs) were discovered. SSCs are massive, compact star clusters that will impact their host galaxies dramatically when their massive stars evolve. Here, we discuss radio, submillimeter, and infrared observations of He 2-10 from 1.87 μm to 6 cm in high angular resolution (~0.3″), which allows us to disentangle individual clusters from aggregate complexes as identified at lower resolution. These results indicate the importance of spatial resolution to characterize SSCs, as low resolution studies of SSCs average over aggregate complexes that may host SSCs at different stages of evolution. We explore the thermal, nonthermal, and dust emission associated with the clusters along with dense molecular tracers to construct a holistic review of the natal SSCs that have yet to dramatically disrupt their parent molecular clouds. We assess the production rate of ionizing photons, extinction, total mass, and the star formation efficiency (SFE) associated with the clusters. Notably, we find that the SFE for the some of the natal clusters is high (&gt;70%), which suggests that these clusters could remain bound even after the gas is dispersed from the system from stellar feedback mechanisms. If they remain bound, these SSCs could survive to become objects indistinguishable from globular clusters. Henize 2–10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central ∼100 pc of the galaxy. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1–0, 3–2), HCN (1–0, 3–2), and HCO+ (1–0, 3–2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating centimeter-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to 340 GHz, with a spectral index of α ≈ ‑ 0.5. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is ≈130 pc × 30 pc and the molecular gas mass is ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially resolved line ratio between CO J = 3–2 and J = 1–0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.",2021,"In the modern universe, supermassive black holes lie at the heart of most, if not all, galaxies with bulges. However, the birth and growth of the first ""seed"" black holes back in the earlier universe is observationally unconstrained.

With ALMA, we now have the first opportunity to study the dense gas presumably feeding the growing black hole in Henize 2-10, a nearby galaxy much like those in the infant universe. We propose Band 6 observations of HCN(3-2) and HCO+(3-2) in the most extended array configuration, which will enable us to probe dense gas within ~10 pc of the nuclear black hole. Sensitive, high-spatial resolution observations, only obtainable with ALMA, are crucial to ensure a clean separation and detection of the AGN-related emission among the nearby, bright star-forming regions. Due to the excellent uv-coverage of ALMA, these observations will also be sensitive to relatively large spatial scales in the galaxy, allowing us to map out the detailed morphology and kinematics of dense gas for the first time in Henize 2-10.

Gim, Hansung B.","Costa, Allison H.; Johnson, Kelsey E.; Indebetouw, Remy; Finn, Molly K.; Brogan, Crystal L.; Reines, Amy Gim, Hansung B.; Reines, Amy E.","Henize 2-10 (He 2-10) is a nearby (D = 9 Mpc) starbursting blue compact dwarf galaxy that boasts a high star formation rate and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. He 2-10 is also one of the first galaxies in which embedded super star clusters (SSCs) were discovered. SSCs are massive, compact star clusters that will impact their host galaxies dramatically when their massive stars evolve. Here, we discuss radio, submillimeter, and infrared observations of He 2-10 from 1.87 μm to 6 cm in high angular resolution (~0.3″), which allows us to disentangle individual clusters from aggregate complexes as identified at lower resolution. These results indicate the importance of spatial resolution to characterize SSCs, as low resolution studies of SSCs average over aggregate complexes that may host SSCs at different stages of evolution. We explore the thermal, nonthermal, and dust emission associated with the clusters along with dense molecular tracers to construct a holistic review of the natal SSCs that have yet to dramatically disrupt their parent molecular clouds. We assess the production rate of ionizing photons, extinction, total mass, and the star formation efficiency (SFE) associated with the clusters. Notably, we find that the SFE for the some of the natal clusters is high (&gt;70%), which suggests that these clusters could remain bound even after the gas is dispersed from the system from stellar feedback mechanisms. If they remain bound, these SSCs could survive to become objects indistinguishable from globular clusters. Henize 2–10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central ∼100 pc of the galaxy. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1–0, 3–2), HCN (1–0, 3–2), and HCO+ (1–0, 3–2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating centimeter-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to 340 GHz, with a spectral index of α ≈ ‑ 0.5. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is ≈130 pc × 30 pc and the molecular gas mass is ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially resolved line ratio between CO J = 3–2 and J = 1–0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.",2021,"In the modern universe, supermassive black holes lie at the heart of most, if not all, galaxies with bulges. However, the birth and growth of the first ""seed"" black holes back in the earlier universe is observationally unconstrained. Recently, we have discovered an accreting massive black hole in the bulgeless dwarf starburst galaxy Henize 2-10 using observations from the VLA, HST and Chandra. With ALMA, we now have the first opportunity to study the dense gas presumably feeding the growing black hole in Henize 2-10, a nearby galaxy much like those in the infant universe. We propose Band 6 observations of HCN(3-2) and HCO+(3-2) in the most extended array configuration, which will enable us to probe dense gas within ~10 pc of the nuclear black hole. Sensitive, high-spatial resolution observations, only obtainable with ALMA, are crucial to ensure a clean separation and detection of the AGN-related emission among the nearby, bright star-forming regions. Due to the excellent uv-coverage of ALMA, these observations will also be sensitive to relatively large spatial scales in the galaxy, allowing us to map out the detailed morphology and kinematics of dense gas for the first time in Henize 2-10.
