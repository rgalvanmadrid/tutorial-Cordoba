We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times. This might suggest that some other physical mechanisms besides self-gravity are helping the GMCs in starbursting mergers collapse and form stars. ...(1)",2021,"We propose to map the nearest major merger, the Antennae, in CO (1-0) and (2-1) at giant molecular clouds scales (~40 pc).

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times. This might suggest that some other physical mechanisms besides self-gravity are helping the GMCs in starbursting mergers collapse and form stars. ...(1)",2021,"We propose to map the nearest major merger, the Antennae, in CO (1-0) and (2-1) at giant molecular clouds scales (~40 pc).

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion (σ <SUB> v </SUB>) versus gas surface density (Σ<SUB>mol</SUB>) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of a factor of 5-10 in both Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> and σ <SUB> v </SUB>, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the σ <SUB> v </SUB> versus Σ<SUB>mol</SUB> diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameters (α <SUB>vir</SUB>) reaching 10-100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in α <SUB>vir</SUB> happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate, which suggests that stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low-α <SUB>vir</SUB> GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times.

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass). The lack of associated thermal radio emission indicates that star formation has not yet altered the environment, and places this cloud at a very early stage of evolution. Given the extremely short lifetime expected for this phase of cluster evolution (< 1Myr), we expect clouds such as this to be exceptionally rare, which is reflected by the fact that this is the only such cloud identified in the ALMA Antennae data set. Thus, we have the opportunity to determine the physical conditions in a proto-globular cluster molecular cloud -- before these conditions have been disrupted by star formation -- for the first time.

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass).

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass). The lack of associated thermal radio emission indicates that star formation has not yet altered the environment, and places this cloud at a very early stage of evolution. Given the extremely short lifetime expected for this phase of cluster evolution (< 1Myr), we expect clouds such as this to be exceptionally rare, which is reflected by the fact that this is the only such cloud identified in the ALMA Antennae data set.

To test this potentially valuable diagnostic trend, we need to see if it is replicated in a variety of environments.

This would be consistent with theoretical expectations that globular cluster formation requires high-pressure environments, much higher than typical values found in the Milky Way. The position-velocity diagram of the cloud and its surrounding material suggests that this high pressure may be produced by ram pressure from the collision of filaments. The radial profile of the column density can be fit with both a Gaussian and a Bonnor-Ebert profile. If the Bonnor-Ebert fit is taken to be indicative of the cloud’s physical structure, it would imply the cloud is gravitationally stable and pressure-confined.

Based on the calculation of the mass, we determine that the commonly used CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor in this region varies spatially, with average values in the range {X}<SUB>CO</SUB>}=(0.12{--}1.1)× {10}<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. We demonstrate that if the cloud is bound (as is circumstantially suggested by its bright, compact morphology), an external pressure in excess of P/k &gt; 10<SUP>8</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP> is required. This would be consistent with theoretical expectations that globular cluster formation requires high-pressure environments, much higher than typical values found in the Milky Way. The position-velocity diagram of the cloud and its surrounding material suggests that this high pressure may be produced by ram pressure from the collision of filaments. The radial profile of the column density can be fit with both a Gaussian and a Bonnor-Ebert profile. If the Bonnor-Ebert fit is taken to be indicative of the cloud’s physical structure, it would imply the cloud is gravitationally stable and pressure-confined. The relative line strengths of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> in this region also suggest that these molecular lines can be used as a tracer for the evolutionary stage of a cluster.",2019,"In Cycle 0 observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass).

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass).

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass).

The major merger that is the Antennae galaxies is forming SSCs and is one of the primary targets to test the cluster formation mechanism. We reanalyzed the archival ALMA CO data of the Antennae and found three typical observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision toward SSC B1 and other SSCs in the overlap region: (i) two velocity components with ˜100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation, (ii) bridge features connecting the two components, and (iii) a complementary spatial distribution between them, lending support to collisions of the two components as a cluster formation mechanism. We present a scenario that two clouds with 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity separation collided, and SSCs having ˜10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> were formed rapidly during that time scale. We compared the present results with the recent studies of star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the SSCs having ˜10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are located. As a result, we found that there is a positive correlation between the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions and the total stellar mass of an SSC, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in SSC formation. The properties of young massive clusters (YMCs) are key to understanding the star formation mechanism in starburst systems, especially mergers. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution (~10 pc) continuum (100 and 345 GHz) data of YMCs in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxy. We identify six sources in the overlap region, including two sources that lie in the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). These YMCs correspond well with radio sources in lower-resolution continuum (100 and 220 GHz) images at GMC scales (~60 pc). We find most of these YMCs are bound clusters through virial analysis. We estimate their ages to be ~1 Myr and that they are either embedded or just beginning to emerge from their parent cloud. We also compare each radio source with a Paβ source, and find they have consistent total ionizing photon numbers, which indicates they are tracing the same physical source. By comparing the free-free emission at ~10 pc scale and ~60 pc scale, we find that ~50% of the free-free emission in GMCs actually comes from these YMCs. This indicates that roughly half of the stars in massive GMCs are formed in bound clusters. We further explore the mass correlation between YMCs and GMCs in the Antennae and find it generally agrees with the predictions of the star cluster simulations. The most massive YMC has a stellar mass that is 1%-5% of its host GMC mass. ...(1)",2019,"In previous ALMA observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass). The lack of associated thermal radio emission indicates that star formation has not yet altered the environment, and places this cloud at a very early stage of evolution. Given the extremely short lifetime expected for this phase of cluster evolution (< 1Myr), we expect clouds such as this to be exceptionally rare, which is reflected by the fact that this is the only such cloud identified in the ALMA Antennae data set.
