In the nearby (D = 14 Mpc) AGN-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068, it has been found that the molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk (CND) is outflowing, which is a manifestation of ongoing AGN feedback. The outflowing gas has a large spread of velocities, which likely drive different shock chemistry signatures at different locations in the CND. <BR /> Aims: We performed a multiline molecular study using two shock tracers, SiO and HNCO, with the aim of determining the gas properties traced by these two species, and we explore the possibility of reconstructing the shock history in the CND. <BR /> Methods: Five SiO transitions and three HNCO transitions were imaged at high resolution 0.″5 − 0.″8 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We performed both LTE and non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with Bayesian inference process in order to characterize the gas properties, such as the molecular gas density and gas temperature. <BR /> Results: We found clear evidence of chemical differentiation between SiO and HNCO, with the SiO/HNCO ratio ranging from greater than one on the east of CND to lower than 1 on the west side. The non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with Bayesian inference confirms that the gas traced by SiO has different densities - and possibly temperatures - than that traced by HNCO. We find that SiO traces gas affected by fast shocks while the gas traced by HNCO is either affected by slow shocks or not shocked at all. <BR /> Conclusions: A distinct differentiation between SiO and HNCO has been revealed in our observations and our further analysis of the gas properties traced by both species confirms the results of previous chemical modelings. ...(3)",2019,"The central 300pc circum-nuclear disk (CND) of Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068 seems to contain X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) and compact shocked regions.

In the nearby (D = 14 Mpc) AGN-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068, it has been found that the molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk (CND) is outflowing, which is a manifestation of ongoing AGN feedback. The outflowing gas has a large spread of velocities, which likely drive different shock chemistry signatures at different locations in the CND. <BR /> Aims: We performed a multiline molecular study using two shock tracers, SiO and HNCO, with the aim of determining the gas properties traced by these two species, and we explore the possibility of reconstructing the shock history in the CND. <BR /> Methods: Five SiO transitions and three HNCO transitions were imaged at high resolution 0.″5 − 0.″8 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We performed both LTE and non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with Bayesian inference process in order to characterize the gas properties, such as the molecular gas density and gas temperature. <BR /> Results: We found clear evidence of chemical differentiation between SiO and HNCO, with the SiO/HNCO ratio ranging from greater than one on the east of CND to lower than 1 on the west side. The non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with Bayesian inference confirms that the gas traced by SiO has different densities - and possibly temperatures - than that traced by HNCO. We find that SiO traces gas affected by fast shocks while the gas traced by HNCO is either affected by slow shocks or not shocked at all. <BR /> Conclusions: A distinct differentiation between SiO and HNCO has been revealed in our observations and our further analysis of the gas properties traced by both species confirms the results of previous chemical modelings. ...(3)",2019,"The central 300pc circum-nuclear disk (CND) of Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068 seems to contain X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) and compact shocked regions.

These transitions, which span a wide range of physical conditions of molecular gas (n(H<SUB>2</SUB>)⊂10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), are instrumental in revealing the density radial stratification and the complex kinematics of the gas in the torus and its surroundings. <BR /> Results: The ALMA images resolve the CND as an asymmetric ringed disk of D ≃ 400 pc in size and ≃1.4 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> in mass. The CND shows a marked deficit of molecular gas in its central ≃130 pc region. The inner edge of the ring is associated with the presence of edge-brightened arcs of NIR polarized emission, which are identified with the current working surface of the ionized wind of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). ALMA proves the existence of an elongated molecular disk/torus in NGC 1068 of M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP> ≃ 3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, which extends over a large range of spatial scales D ≃ 10 - 30 pc around the central engine. The new observations evidence the density radial stratification of the torus: the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) torus, with a full size D<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4 - 3)</SUB> = 11 ± 0.6 pc, is a factor of between two and three smaller than its CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) counterparts, which have full sizes of D<SUB>CO(3 - 2)</SUB> = 26 ± 0.6 pc and D<SUB>CO(2 - 1)</SUB> = 28 ± 0.6 pc, respectively. This result brings into light the many faces of the molecular torus. The torus is connected to the CND through a network of molecular gas streamers detected inside the CND ring. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular motions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND ring. These velocity field distortions are interconnected and are part of a 3D outflow that reflects the effects of AGN feedback on the kinematics of molecular gas across a wide range of spatial scales around the central engine.

In particular, we estimate through modeling that a significant fraction of the gas inside the torus (≃ 0.4 - 0.6 × M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP>) and a comparable amount of mass along the gas streamers are outflowing. However, the bulk of the mass, momentum, and energy of the molecular outflow of NGC 1068 is contained at larger radii in the CND region, where the AGN wind and the radio jet are currently pushing the gas assembled at the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) ring of the nuclear stellar bar. <BR /> Conclusions: In our favored scenario a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the accretion disk of NGC1068 is currently impacting a sizable fraction of the gas inside the torus. However, a large gas reservoir (≃1.2 - 1.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>), which lies close to the equatorial plane of the torus, remains unaffected by the feedback of the AGN wind and can therefore continue fueling the AGN for at least ≃1 - 4 Myr.

These velocity field distortions are interconnected and are part of a 3D outflow that reflects the effects of AGN feedback on the kinematics of molecular gas across a wide range of spatial scales around the central engine. In particular, we estimate through modeling that a significant fraction of the gas inside the torus (≃ 0.4 - 0.6 × M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP>) and a comparable amount of mass along the gas streamers are outflowing. However, the bulk of the mass, momentum, and energy of the molecular outflow of NGC 1068 is contained at larger radii in the CND region, where the AGN wind and the radio jet are currently pushing the gas assembled at the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) ring of the nuclear stellar bar. <BR /> Conclusions: In our favored scenario a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the accretion disk of NGC1068 is currently impacting a sizable fraction of the gas inside the torus. However, a large gas reservoir (≃1.2 - 1.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>), which lies close to the equatorial plane of the torus, remains unaffected by the feedback of the AGN wind and can therefore continue fueling the AGN for at least ≃1 - 4 Myr.

These transitions, which span a wide range of physical conditions of molecular gas (n(H<SUB>2</SUB>)⊂10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), are instrumental in revealing the density radial stratification and the complex kinematics of the gas in the torus and its surroundings. <BR /> Results: The ALMA images resolve the CND as an asymmetric ringed disk of D ≃ 400 pc in size and ≃1.4 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> in mass. The CND shows a marked deficit of molecular gas in its central ≃130 pc region. The inner edge of the ring is associated with the presence of edge-brightened arcs of NIR polarized emission, which are identified with the current working surface of the ionized wind of the active galactic nucleus (AGN).

The new observations evidence the density radial stratification of the torus: the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) torus, with a full size D<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4 - 3)</SUB> = 11 ± 0.6 pc, is a factor of between two and three smaller than its CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) counterparts, which have full sizes of D<SUB>CO(3 - 2)</SUB> = 26 ± 0.6 pc and D<SUB>CO(2 - 1)</SUB> = 28 ± 0.6 pc, respectively. This result brings into light the many faces of the molecular torus. The torus is connected to the CND through a network of molecular gas streamers detected inside the CND ring. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular motions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND ring. These velocity field distortions are interconnected and are part of a 3D outflow that reflects the effects of AGN feedback on the kinematics of molecular gas across a wide range of spatial scales around the central engine. In particular, we estimate through modeling that a significant fraction of the gas inside the torus (≃ 0.4 - 0.6 × M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP>) and a comparable amount of mass along the gas streamers are outflowing. However, the bulk of the mass, momentum, and energy of the molecular outflow of NGC 1068 is contained at larger radii in the CND region, where the AGN wind and the radio jet are currently pushing the gas assembled at the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) ring of the nuclear stellar bar. <BR /> Conclusions: In our favored scenario a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the accretion disk of NGC1068 is currently impacting a sizable fraction of the gas inside the torus. However, a large gas reservoir (≃1.2 - 1.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>), which lies close to the equatorial plane of the torus, remains unaffected by the feedback of the AGN wind and can therefore continue fueling the AGN for at least ≃1 - 4 Myr.

These transitions, which span a wide range of physical conditions of molecular gas (n(H<SUB>2</SUB>)⊂10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), are instrumental in revealing the density radial stratification and the complex kinematics of the gas in the torus and its surroundings. <BR /> Results: The ALMA images resolve the CND as an asymmetric ringed disk of D ≃ 400 pc in size and ≃1.4 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> in mass. The CND shows a marked deficit of molecular gas in its central ≃130 pc region. The inner edge of the ring is associated with the presence of edge-brightened arcs of NIR polarized emission, which are identified with the current working surface of the ionized wind of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). ALMA proves the existence of an elongated molecular disk/torus in NGC 1068 of M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP> ≃ 3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, which extends over a large range of spatial scales D ≃ 10 - 30 pc around the central engine. The new observations evidence the density radial stratification of the torus: the HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4-3) torus, with a full size D<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(4 - 3)</SUB> = 11 ± 0.6 pc, is a factor of between two and three smaller than its CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) counterparts, which have full sizes of D<SUB>CO(3 - 2)</SUB> = 26 ± 0.6 pc and D<SUB>CO(2 - 1)</SUB> = 28 ± 0.6 pc, respectively. This result brings into light the many faces of the molecular torus. The torus is connected to the CND through a network of molecular gas streamers detected inside the CND ring. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular motions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND ring. These velocity field distortions are interconnected and are part of a 3D outflow that reflects the effects of AGN feedback on the kinematics of molecular gas across a wide range of spatial scales around the central engine. In particular, we estimate through modeling that a significant fraction of the gas inside the torus (≃ 0.4 - 0.6 × M<SUB>torus</SUB><SUP>gas</SUP>) and a comparable amount of mass along the gas streamers are outflowing. However, the bulk of the mass, momentum, and energy of the molecular outflow of NGC 1068 is contained at larger radii in the CND region, where the AGN wind and the radio jet are currently pushing the gas assembled at the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) ring of the nuclear stellar bar. <BR /> Conclusions: In our favored scenario a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the accretion disk of NGC1068 is currently impacting a sizable fraction of the gas inside the torus. However, a large gas reservoir (≃1.2 - 1.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>), which lies close to the equatorial plane of the torus, remains unaffected by the feedback of the AGN wind and can therefore continue fueling the AGN for at least ≃1 - 4 Myr.

Michiyama, Tomonari; Inoue, Yoshiyuki; Doi, Akihiro","To understand the origin of nuclear (≲100 pc) millimeter-wave (mm-wave) continuum emission in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we systematically analyzed subarcsecond resolution Band-6 (211-275 GHz) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of 98 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.05) from the 70 month Swift/BAT catalog. The sample, almost unbiased for obscured systems, provides the largest number of AGNs to date with high mm-wave spatial resolution sampling (~1-200 pc), and spans broad ranges of 14-150 keV luminosity { $40\lt \mathrm{log}[{L}_{14-150}/(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})]\lt 45$ }, black hole mass $[5\lt \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })\lt 10$ ], and Eddington ratio ( $-4\lt \mathrm{log}{\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}\lt 2$ ). We find a significant correlation between 1.3 mm (230 GHz) and 14-150 keV luminosities. Its scatter is ≍0.36 dex, and the mm-wave emission may serve as a good proxy of the AGN luminosity, free of dust extinction up to N <SUB>H</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>26</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. While the mm-wave emission could be self-absorbed synchrotron radiation around the X-ray corona according to past works, we also discuss different possible origins of the mm-wave emission: AGN-related dust emission, outflow-driven shocks, and a small-scale (&lt;200 pc) jet. The dust emission is unlikely to be dominant, as the mm-wave slope is generally flatter than expected. Also, due to no increase in the mm-wave luminosity with the Eddington ratio, a radiation-driven outflow model is possibly not the common mechanism. Furthermore, we find independence of the mm-wave luminosity on indicators of the inclination angle from the polar axis of the nuclear structure, which is inconsistent with a jet model whose luminosity depends only on the angle. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. ...(2)",2020,"We propose the longest-baseline ALMA band 6 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068. Our Cycle-4 data of HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 lines have revealed clearly, for the first time, the long-sought-after rotation of dense molecular gas along the putative torus direction around a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, we have also found surprising torus properties, when compared to a classical torus picture; (1) the torus dense molecular emission is highly asymmetric, and (2) rotation at a few pc scale is far from Keplerian motion. With the proposed 0.02"" (~1pc) resolution data of HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines, as well as the isotopologue H13CN J=3-2 line, we will (1) investigate the origin of the asymmetric dense molecular emission, (2) derive mass distribution of the torus from the optically-thin isotopologue line, and (3) search for mass inflow signatures and Keplerian velocity increase toward the central SMBH.

Michiyama, Tomonari; Inoue, Yoshiyuki; Doi, Akihiro","To understand the origin of nuclear (≲100 pc) millimeter-wave (mm-wave) continuum emission in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we systematically analyzed subarcsecond resolution Band-6 (211-275 GHz) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of 98 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.05) from the 70 month Swift/BAT catalog. The sample, almost unbiased for obscured systems, provides the largest number of AGNs to date with high mm-wave spatial resolution sampling (~1-200 pc), and spans broad ranges of 14-150 keV luminosity { $40\lt \mathrm{log}[{L}_{14-150}/(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})]\lt 45$ }, black hole mass $[5\lt \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })\lt 10$ ], and Eddington ratio ( $-4\lt \mathrm{log}{\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}\lt 2$ ). We find a significant correlation between 1.3 mm (230 GHz) and 14-150 keV luminosities. Its scatter is ≍0.36 dex, and the mm-wave emission may serve as a good proxy of the AGN luminosity, free of dust extinction up to N <SUB>H</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>26</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. While the mm-wave emission could be self-absorbed synchrotron radiation around the X-ray corona according to past works, we also discuss different possible origins of the mm-wave emission: AGN-related dust emission, outflow-driven shocks, and a small-scale (&lt;200 pc) jet. The dust emission is unlikely to be dominant, as the mm-wave slope is generally flatter than expected. Also, due to no increase in the mm-wave luminosity with the Eddington ratio, a radiation-driven outflow model is possibly not the common mechanism. Furthermore, we find independence of the mm-wave luminosity on indicators of the inclination angle from the polar axis of the nuclear structure, which is inconsistent with a jet model whose luminosity depends only on the angle. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. ...(2)",2020,"We propose the longest-baseline ALMA band 6 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068. Our Cycle-4 data of HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 lines have revealed clearly, for the first time, the long-sought-after rotation of dense molecular gas along the putative torus direction around a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, we have also found surprising torus properties, when compared to a classical torus picture; (1) the torus dense molecular emission is highly asymmetric, and (2) rotation at a few pc scale is far from Keplerian motion. With the proposed 0.02"" (~1pc) resolution data of HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines, as well as the isotopologue H13CN J=3-2 line, we will (1) investigate the origin of the asymmetric dense molecular emission, (2) derive mass distribution of the torus from the optically-thin isotopologue line, and (3) search for mass inflow signatures and Keplerian velocity increase toward the central SMBH.

These observations have confirmed the presence of a geometrically thick torus with an orbital motion of its matter and the velocity distribution which can refl ect the clumpy structure. In the framework of N-body simulations we consider a dynamical model of an obscuring torus which accounts for the gravitational interaction between the clouds moving in the field of the central mass. In the considered model, clouds are orbiting around the central mass exhibiting a spread in inclination and eccentricity. The self-gravity of the torus induces the velocity distribution of clouds with a global orbital motion which mimics the ALMA data for NGC1068. The results of high-resolution spectral-line observations of dense molecular gas are presented towards the nuclear region of the type 2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. MERLIN observations of the 22 GHz H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser were made for imaging the known off-nuclear maser emission at radio jet component located about 0.3 arcsec north-east of the radio nucleus in the galaxy. High angular resolution ALMA observations have spatially resolved the molecular gas emissions of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> in this region. The off-nuclear maser spots are found to nearly overlap with a ring-like molecular gas structure and are tracing an evolving shock-like structure, which appears to be energized by interaction between the radio jet and circumnuclear medium. The scenario of the dynamic jet-ISM interaction is further supported by a systematic shift of the centroid velocities of the off-nuclear maser features over a period of 35 yr. The enhanced integrated flux ratios of the HCN to HCO<SUP>+</SUP> line emission features at component C suggest a kinetic temperature T<SUB>k</SUB> ≳ 300 K and an H<SUB>2</SUB> density of ≳ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, which are conditions where water masers may be formed. The diagnostics of the masering action in this jet-ISM interaction region is exemplary for galaxies hosting off-nuclear H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser emission. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. ...(4)",2018,"We propose ALMA band 6 high angular resolution (<0.07"") HCN 3-2 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068.

This is a very important milestone to scrutinize the properties of dusty molecular torus which are still poorly understood observationally. In this proposal, we aim to spatially resolve the compact torus molecular emission to investigate its dynamics and to obtain an important clue about its origin. Additionally, we aim to investigate the possibly detected emission in our ALMA Cycle 2 data which may bridge between the torus and bright eastern knot in the host galaxy, to confirm if we are witnessing molecular gas inflow from the host galaxy to the torus.

These observations have confirmed the presence of a geometrically thick torus with an orbital motion of its matter and the velocity distribution which can refl ect the clumpy structure. In the framework of N-body simulations we consider a dynamical model of an obscuring torus which accounts for the gravitational interaction between the clouds moving in the field of the central mass. In the considered model, clouds are orbiting around the central mass exhibiting a spread in inclination and eccentricity. The self-gravity of the torus induces the velocity distribution of clouds with a global orbital motion which mimics the ALMA data for NGC1068. The results of high-resolution spectral-line observations of dense molecular gas are presented towards the nuclear region of the type 2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. MERLIN observations of the 22 GHz H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser were made for imaging the known off-nuclear maser emission at radio jet component located about 0.3 arcsec north-east of the radio nucleus in the galaxy. High angular resolution ALMA observations have spatially resolved the molecular gas emissions of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> in this region. The off-nuclear maser spots are found to nearly overlap with a ring-like molecular gas structure and are tracing an evolving shock-like structure, which appears to be energized by interaction between the radio jet and circumnuclear medium. The scenario of the dynamic jet-ISM interaction is further supported by a systematic shift of the centroid velocities of the off-nuclear maser features over a period of 35 yr. The enhanced integrated flux ratios of the HCN to HCO<SUP>+</SUP> line emission features at component C suggest a kinetic temperature T<SUB>k</SUB> ≳ 300 K and an H<SUB>2</SUB> density of ≳ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, which are conditions where water masers may be formed. The diagnostics of the masering action in this jet-ISM interaction region is exemplary for galaxies hosting off-nuclear H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser emission. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. ...(4)",2018,"We propose ALMA band 6 high angular resolution (<0.07"") HCN 3-2 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068. Our ALMA Cycle 2 data with 0.1"" x 0.2"" spatial resolution clearly identified compact dense molecular gas emission which is believed to be associated with the putative AGN dusty molecular torus, by separating from nearby spatially extended bright emission in the host galaxy. This is a very important milestone to scrutinize the properties of dusty molecular torus which are still poorly understood observationally. In this proposal, we aim to spatially resolve the compact torus molecular emission to investigate its dynamics and to obtain an important clue about its origin. Additionally, we aim to investigate the possibly detected emission in our ALMA Cycle 2 data which may bridge between the torus and bright eastern knot in the host galaxy, to confirm if we are witnessing molecular gas inflow from the host galaxy to the torus.

The sample, almost unbiased for obscured systems, provides the largest number of AGNs to date with high mm-wave spatial resolution sampling (~1-200 pc), and spans broad ranges of 14-150 keV luminosity { $40\lt \mathrm{log}[{L}_{14-150}/(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})]\lt 45$ }, black hole mass $[5\lt \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })\lt 10$ ], and Eddington ratio ( $-4\lt \mathrm{log}{\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}\lt 2$ ). We find a significant correlation between 1.3 mm (230 GHz) and 14-150 keV luminosities. Its scatter is ≍0.36 dex, and the mm-wave emission may serve as a good proxy of the AGN luminosity, free of dust extinction up to N <SUB>H</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>26</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. While the mm-wave emission could be self-absorbed synchrotron radiation around the X-ray corona according to past works, we also discuss different possible origins of the mm-wave emission: AGN-related dust emission, outflow-driven shocks, and a small-scale (&lt;200 pc) jet. The dust emission is unlikely to be dominant, as the mm-wave slope is generally flatter than expected. Also, due to no increase in the mm-wave luminosity with the Eddington ratio, a radiation-driven outflow model is possibly not the common mechanism. Furthermore, we find independence of the mm-wave luminosity on indicators of the inclination angle from the polar axis of the nuclear structure, which is inconsistent with a jet model whose luminosity depends only on the angle. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses.

Michiyama, Tomonari; Inoue, Yoshiyuki; Doi, Akihiro","To understand the origin of nuclear (≲100 pc) millimeter-wave (mm-wave) continuum emission in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we systematically analyzed subarcsecond resolution Band-6 (211-275 GHz) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of 98 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.05) from the 70 month Swift/BAT catalog. The sample, almost unbiased for obscured systems, provides the largest number of AGNs to date with high mm-wave spatial resolution sampling (~1-200 pc), and spans broad ranges of 14-150 keV luminosity { $40\lt \mathrm{log}[{L}_{14-150}/(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})]\lt 45$ }, black hole mass $[5\lt \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })\lt 10$ ], and Eddington ratio ( $-4\lt \mathrm{log}{\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}\lt 2$ ). We find a significant correlation between 1.3 mm (230 GHz) and 14-150 keV luminosities. Its scatter is ≍0.36 dex, and the mm-wave emission may serve as a good proxy of the AGN luminosity, free of dust extinction up to N <SUB>H</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>26</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. While the mm-wave emission could be self-absorbed synchrotron radiation around the X-ray corona according to past works, we also discuss different possible origins of the mm-wave emission: AGN-related dust emission, outflow-driven shocks, and a small-scale (&lt;200 pc) jet. The dust emission is unlikely to be dominant, as the mm-wave slope is generally flatter than expected. Also, due to no increase in the mm-wave luminosity with the Eddington ratio, a radiation-driven outflow model is possibly not the common mechanism. Furthermore, we find independence of the mm-wave luminosity on indicators of the inclination angle from the polar axis of the nuclear structure, which is inconsistent with a jet model whose luminosity depends only on the angle. We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data for the nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with an angular resolution of 005, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analyses. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. ...(2)",2020,"We propose the longest-baseline ALMA band 6 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068. Our Cycle-4 data of HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 lines have revealed clearly, for the first time, the long-sought-after rotation of dense molecular gas along the putative torus direction around a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, we have also found surprising torus properties, when compared to a classical torus picture; (1) the torus dense molecular emission is highly asymmetric, and (2) rotation at a few pc scale is far from Keplerian motion. With the proposed 0.02"" (~1pc) resolution data of HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines, as well as the isotopologue H13CN J=3-2 line, we will (1) investigate the origin of the asymmetric dense molecular emission, (2) derive mass distribution of the torus from the optically-thin isotopologue line, and (3) search for mass inflow signatures and Keplerian velocity increase toward the central SMBH.

These observations have confirmed the presence of a geometrically thick torus with an orbital motion of its matter and the velocity distribution which can refl ect the clumpy structure. In the framework of N-body simulations we consider a dynamical model of an obscuring torus which accounts for the gravitational interaction between the clouds moving in the field of the central mass. In the considered model, clouds are orbiting around the central mass exhibiting a spread in inclination and eccentricity. The self-gravity of the torus induces the velocity distribution of clouds with a global orbital motion which mimics the ALMA data for NGC1068. The results of high-resolution spectral-line observations of dense molecular gas are presented towards the nuclear region of the type 2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. MERLIN observations of the 22 GHz H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser were made for imaging the known off-nuclear maser emission at radio jet component located about 0.3 arcsec north-east of the radio nucleus in the galaxy. High angular resolution ALMA observations have spatially resolved the molecular gas emissions of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> in this region. The off-nuclear maser spots are found to nearly overlap with a ring-like molecular gas structure and are tracing an evolving shock-like structure, which appears to be energized by interaction between the radio jet and circumnuclear medium. The scenario of the dynamic jet-ISM interaction is further supported by a systematic shift of the centroid velocities of the off-nuclear maser features over a period of 35 yr. The enhanced integrated flux ratios of the HCN to HCO<SUP>+</SUP> line emission features at component C suggest a kinetic temperature T<SUB>k</SUB> ≳ 300 K and an H<SUB>2</SUB> density of ≳ 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, which are conditions where water masers may be formed.

Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole.

Since our observing strategy is based on our available ALMA Cycle 2 data, the feasibility to accomplish our science goals is expected to be high.",NGC_1068_a_06_TM1,"Izumi, Takuma; Nakanishi, Kouichiro;",0.4589675589621781,0.018495293603568108,0.22781858,uid://A001/X88e/X5f,uid://A001/X88e/X60,uid://A002/Xc46ab2/X1451,Scrutinizing the properties of AGN dusty molecular torus,S,TARGET,T,0.8912517597670544,F,2018ApJ...853L..25I 2020A&AT...31..423B 2020ApJ...902...99I 2021MNRAS.503.1459B 2021PASJ...73..338N 2023PASJ...75..874M 2024MNRAS.528.3668H,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)/Quasars (QSO), Galactic centres/nuclei",Active galaxies,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Imanishi, Masatoshi",,miamanishi

One therefore expects to probe the broad-line region (BLR) of an obscured (type 2) active galactic nucleus (AGN) with those lines. However, admitting the large uncertainty in the continuum level, here we report on the non-detection of both broad and narrow H26 α emission line (rest frequency = 353.62 GHz) towards the prototypical type 2 AGN of NGC 1068 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We also investigate the nature of BLR clouds that can potentially emit submm-RLs with model calculations. As a result, we suggest that clouds with an electron density (Ne) of ˜109 cm-3 can mainly contribute to broad submm-RLs in terms of the line flux. On the other hand, line flux from other density clouds would be insignificant considering their too large or too small line optical depths. However, even for the case of Ne ˜ 109 cm-3 clouds, we also suggest that the expected line flux is extremely low, which is impractical to detect even with ALMA. We present ALMA ∼0""02 resolution observations of the nucleus of the nearby (∼14 Mpc) type 2 active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 at HCN/HCO<SUP>+</SUP>/HNC J = 3-2 lines, as well as at their <SUP>13</SUP>C isotopologue and vibrationally excited lines, to scrutinize the morphological, dynamical, chemical, and physical properties of dense molecular gas in the putative dusty molecular torus around a mass-accreting supermassive black hole. We confirm almost east-west-oriented dense molecular gas emission both morphologically and dynamically, which we regard as coming from the torus. Bright emission is compact (≲3 pc), and low-surface-brightness emission extends out to 5-7 pc. These dense molecular gas properties are not symmetric between the eastern and western torus. The HCN J = 3-2 emission is stronger than the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 3-2 emission within the ∼7 pc torus region, with an estimated dense molecular mass of (0.4-1.0) × 10<SUP>6 </SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We interpret that HCN abundance is enhanced in the torus. We detect signatures of outflowing dense molecular gas and a vibrationally excited HCN J = 3-2 line. Finally, we find that in the innermost (≲1 pc) part of the torus, the dense molecular line rotation velocity, relative to the systemic velocity, is the opposite of that in the outer (≳2 pc) part, in both the eastern and western torus. We prefer a scenario of counter-rotating dense molecular gas with innermost almost Keplerian rotation and outer slowly rotating (far below Keplerian) components. Our high-spatial-resolution dense molecular line data reveal that torus properties of NGC 1068 are much more complicated than the simple axisymmetrically rotating torus picture in the classical active galactic nucleus unification paradigm. ...(3)",2016,"We propose HCN/HCO+/HNC observations at vibrationally-excited and -ground levels, of the nearby bright AGN-dominated nucleus of NGC 1068. Our scientific goal is to estimate the strengths of vibrationally-excited emission lines of HCN/HCO+/HNC, and to clarify whether infrared radiative pumping indeed selectively boosts HCN emission, when compared to HCO+ and HNC. Detailed study of this prototypical pure AGN will play a crucial role to resolve the highly disputed issue of whether infrared radiative pumping is indeed important to enhance HCN emission in many AGNs. If the infrared radaitive pumping is ubiquitously at work for HCN excitation in AGNs, vibrationally excited HCN emission lines must be clearly detected in the NGC 1068 nucleus with ALMA. If these lines are not detected, ubiquitous role of infrared radiative pumping for enhanced HCN emission in AGNs is strongly ruled out. ALMA's high-spatial-resolution (<0.6 arcsec) is vital to probe only the AGN-dominated nuclear region, with minimum contamination from surrounding starburst activity in the host galaxy.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5. We suggest that SN 2018ivc represents a missing link between SNe IIP and SNe IIb/Ib/Ic in the binary evolution scenario. ...(1)",2023,"The circumstellar material (CSM) in the vicinity of a supernova is a unique probe to the still-unresolved evolution of massive stars in the final decades to centuries. We propose a DDT observation of type II supernova (SN II) 2018ivc in Bands 3 and 6, at ~160-220 days since the explosion (May-June 2019). Our Cycle 6 observation of SN 2018ivc just after the explosion (Nov-Dec 2018) clearly showed the existence of (only) moderately dense CSM (corresponding to the mass loss rate of 10**-4 Msun/yr, assuming the mass loss wind velocity of 100 km/s) extending at least up to ~2 x 10**15 cm.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5.

Our Cycle 6 observation of SN 2018ivc just after the explosion (Nov-Dec 2018) clearly showed the existence of (only) moderately dense CSM (corresponding to the mass loss rate of 10**-4 Msun/yr, assuming the mass loss wind velocity of 100 km/s) extending at least up to ~2 x 10**15 cm. This is qualitatively different from a recently proposed (and widely accepted) scenario, as inferred by optical observations, in which SNe II (may commonly) show an extremely dense CSM (~10**-3 Msun/yr for 100 km/s) only in the very close vicinity (~10*15 cm). The proposed observation will further probe the CSM distribution up to ~2 x 10**16 cm to search for a possible change in the pre-SN mass loss rate and to characterize a diversity in the final evolution of massive stars.",SN2018iv_a_06_TM1,"Moriya, Takashi; Nozawa, Takaya; Kundu, Esha; Ryder, Stuart; Patnaude, Dan; Fujisawa, Kenta; Folatelli, Gaston; Saito, Tomoki; Momose, Rieko; Matsuoka, Tomoki; Lee, Shiu-Hang; Kuncarayakti, Hanindyo; Chandra, Poonam;",0.41339029005907735,0.013667545895846489,0.8041977,uid://A001/X13c4/X8e,uid://A001/X13c4/X8f,uid://A002/Xdd7274/X34fb,Further Follow-Up Observations of a Nearby Type II Supernova 2018ivc,S,TARGET,T,0.2872521246659613,T,2023ApJ...942...17M 2023ApJ...945L...3M 2023PASJ...75..874M,"Supernovae (SN) ejecta, Transients",Stars and stellar evolution,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Maeda, Keiichi",,kmaeda

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5.

Here we present a result of our long-term monitoring of the peculiar Type IIL SN 2018ivc using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting ~1 yr after the explosion. This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron emission and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the optically thin regime, unlike the optically thick centimeter emission. As such, we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter and thus the mass-loss history in the final ≳1000 yr. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) ~1500 yr before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately high mass-loss rate (≳10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) up until the explosion. From this behavior, we suggest that SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c, without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive envelope). SN 2018ivc is an unusual Type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope and SNe IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light-curve evolution more complicated than that of canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of an He star with a modest (~0.5-1M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the ""canonical"" SN IIb ejecta) for which the multiwavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu, which shows a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 yr, is higher than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5.

By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. We present 1.4 pc resolution observations of 256 GHz nuclear radio continuum and HCN (J = 3 → 2) in the molecular torus of NGC 1068. The integrated radio continuum emission has a flat spectrum consistent with free-free emission and resolves into an X-shaped structure resembling an edge-brightened bicone. HCN is detected in absorption against the continuum, and the absorption spectrum shows a pronounced blue wing that suggests a high-velocity molecular outflow with speeds reaching 450 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Analysis of the off-nucleus emission line kinematics and morphology reveals two nested, rotating disk components. The inner disk, inside r ̃ 1.2 pc, has kinematics that are consistent with the nearly edge-on, geometrically thin H<SUB>2</SUB>O megamaser disk in Keplerian rotation around a central mass of 1.66 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. The outer disk, which extends to ̃7 pc radius, counter-rotates relative to the inner disk. The rotation curve of the outer disk is consistent with rotation around the same central mass as the megamaser disk but in the opposite sense. The morphology of the molecular gas is asymmetric around the nuclear continuum source. We speculate that the outer disk formed from more recently introduced molecular gas falling out of the host galaxy or from a captured dwarf satellite galaxy. In NGC 1068, we find direct evidence that the molecular torus consists of counter-rotating and misaligned disks on parsec scales. ...(2)",2019,"In Cycle 3, we observed the central few parsecs of the active nucleus of NGC~1068 and discovered a high-velocity (+/- 400 km/s) outflow in the molecular tracers CO 6-5 (80~mas beam) and HCN 4-3 (150 mas beam). The observations essentially rule out the classic ""donut"" paradigm for the medium that obscures our sight-line to the broad line region. Rather, the geometry appears to be more of a bipolar outflow resembling the molecular outflows of protostars. However, the outflow is only marginally resolved, making it impossible to discern the dynamical nature of the outflow. We therefore propose to observe the outflow at the best angular resolution afforded by ALMA, 20~mas (1.4 pc), in the CO 2-1 and HCN 3-2 lines. The proposed observations will provide the best possible constraints on the kinematics of the outflow, and in addition will afford the best constraints on the conditions in the near-AGN molecular gas on parsec scales.",NGC1068_b_06_TM1,"Marconi, Alessandro; O'Dea, Christopher; Impellizzeri, Violette; Lutz, Dieter; Baum, Stefi; Elitzur, Moshe; Maiolino, Roberto;",0.4309602599607579,0.014460568681258187,1.2519251,uid://A001/X1296/X3b7,uid://A001/X1296/X3b8,uid://A002/Xc59134/X1257,Mapping the Molecular Outflow of NGC1068,S,TARGET,T,0.384902186968048,T,2019ApJ...884L..28I 2020ApJ...902...99I 2023MNRAS.519...34H 2023PASJ...75..874M,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)/Quasars (QSO), Outflows, jets, feedback",Active galaxies,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Gallimore, Jack",,jgallimo

By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. We present 1.4 pc resolution observations of 256 GHz nuclear radio continuum and HCN (J = 3 → 2) in the molecular torus of NGC 1068. The integrated radio continuum emission has a flat spectrum consistent with free-free emission and resolves into an X-shaped structure resembling an edge-brightened bicone. HCN is detected in absorption against the continuum, and the absorption spectrum shows a pronounced blue wing that suggests a high-velocity molecular outflow with speeds reaching 450 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Analysis of the off-nucleus emission line kinematics and morphology reveals two nested, rotating disk components. The inner disk, inside r ̃ 1.2 pc, has kinematics that are consistent with the nearly edge-on, geometrically thin H<SUB>2</SUB>O megamaser disk in Keplerian rotation around a central mass of 1.66 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. The outer disk, which extends to ̃7 pc radius, counter-rotates relative to the inner disk. The rotation curve of the outer disk is consistent with rotation around the same central mass as the megamaser disk but in the opposite sense. The morphology of the molecular gas is asymmetric around the nuclear continuum source. We speculate that the outer disk formed from more recently introduced molecular gas falling out of the host galaxy or from a captured dwarf satellite galaxy. In NGC 1068, we find direct evidence that the molecular torus consists of counter-rotating and misaligned disks on parsec scales. ...(2)",2019,"In Cycle 3, we observed the central few parsecs of the active nucleus of NGC~1068 and discovered a high-velocity (+/- 400 km/s) outflow in the molecular tracers CO 6-5 (80~mas beam) and HCN 4-3 (150 mas beam). The observations essentially rule out the classic ""donut"" paradigm for the medium that obscures our sight-line to the broad line region. Rather, the geometry appears to be more of a bipolar outflow resembling the molecular outflows of protostars. However, the outflow is only marginally resolved, making it impossible to discern the dynamical nature of the outflow. We therefore propose to observe the outflow at the best angular resolution afforded by ALMA, 20~mas (1.4 pc), in the CO 2-1 and HCN 3-2 lines. The proposed observations will provide the best possible constraints on the kinematics of the outflow, and in addition will afford the best constraints on the conditions in the near-AGN molecular gas on parsec scales.",NGC1068_b_06_TM1,"Marconi, Alessandro; O'Dea, Christopher; Impellizzeri, Violette; Lutz, Dieter; Baum, Stefi; Elitzur, Moshe; Maiolino, Roberto;",0.4213864198143251,0.014460568681258187,1.2519251,uid://A001/X1296/X3b7,uid://A001/X1296/X3b8,uid://A002/Xc59134/X1257,Mapping the Molecular Outflow of NGC1068,S,TARGET,T,0.384902186968048,T,2019ApJ...884L..28I 2020ApJ...902...99I 2023MNRAS.519...34H 2023PASJ...75..874M,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)/Quasars (QSO), Outflows, jets, feedback",Active galaxies,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Gallimore, Jack",,jgallimo

By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. We present 1.4 pc resolution observations of 256 GHz nuclear radio continuum and HCN (J = 3 → 2) in the molecular torus of NGC 1068. The integrated radio continuum emission has a flat spectrum consistent with free-free emission and resolves into an X-shaped structure resembling an edge-brightened bicone. HCN is detected in absorption against the continuum, and the absorption spectrum shows a pronounced blue wing that suggests a high-velocity molecular outflow with speeds reaching 450 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Analysis of the off-nucleus emission line kinematics and morphology reveals two nested, rotating disk components. The inner disk, inside r ̃ 1.2 pc, has kinematics that are consistent with the nearly edge-on, geometrically thin H<SUB>2</SUB>O megamaser disk in Keplerian rotation around a central mass of 1.66 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. The outer disk, which extends to ̃7 pc radius, counter-rotates relative to the inner disk. The rotation curve of the outer disk is consistent with rotation around the same central mass as the megamaser disk but in the opposite sense. The morphology of the molecular gas is asymmetric around the nuclear continuum source. We speculate that the outer disk formed from more recently introduced molecular gas falling out of the host galaxy or from a captured dwarf satellite galaxy. In NGC 1068, we find direct evidence that the molecular torus consists of counter-rotating and misaligned disks on parsec scales. ...(2)",2019,"In Cycle 3, we observed the central few parsecs of the active nucleus of NGC~1068 and discovered a high-velocity (+/- 400 km/s) outflow in the molecular tracers CO 6-5 (80~mas beam) and HCN 4-3 (150 mas beam). The observations essentially rule out the classic ""donut"" paradigm for the medium that obscures our sight-line to the broad line region. Rather, the geometry appears to be more of a bipolar outflow resembling the molecular outflows of protostars. However, the outflow is only marginally resolved, making it impossible to discern the dynamical nature of the outflow. We therefore propose to observe the outflow at the best angular resolution afforded by ALMA, 20~mas (1.4 pc), in the CO 2-1 and HCN 3-2 lines.

By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broad-band radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068. We find that the flux density is between ≈10 and 20 mJy at 5-700 GHz. Due to the inability of the model in previous studies to account for the newly added 100 GHz data point, we proceeded to update the models and make the necessary adjustments to the parameters. One possible interpretation of this broad-band radio spectrum is a combination of emission from the jet base, the dusty torus, and the compact X-raying corona with a magnetic field strength of ≈20 G on scales of ≈30 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. In order to firmly identify the compact corona by omitting any other possible extended components (e.g., free-free emission from ionized gas in the vicinity), high-resolution/sensitivity observations achieved by next-generation interferometers will be necessary. We present 1.4 pc resolution observations of 256 GHz nuclear radio continuum and HCN (J = 3 → 2) in the molecular torus of NGC 1068. The integrated radio continuum emission has a flat spectrum consistent with free-free emission and resolves into an X-shaped structure resembling an edge-brightened bicone. HCN is detected in absorption against the continuum, and the absorption spectrum shows a pronounced blue wing that suggests a high-velocity molecular outflow with speeds reaching 450 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Analysis of the off-nucleus emission line kinematics and morphology reveals two nested, rotating disk components. The inner disk, inside r ̃ 1.2 pc, has kinematics that are consistent with the nearly edge-on, geometrically thin H<SUB>2</SUB>O megamaser disk in Keplerian rotation around a central mass of 1.66 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB>. The outer disk, which extends to ̃7 pc radius, counter-rotates relative to the inner disk. The rotation curve of the outer disk is consistent with rotation around the same central mass as the megamaser disk but in the opposite sense. The morphology of the molecular gas is asymmetric around the nuclear continuum source. We speculate that the outer disk formed from more recently introduced molecular gas falling out of the host galaxy or from a captured dwarf satellite galaxy. In NGC 1068, we find direct evidence that the molecular torus consists of counter-rotating and misaligned disks on parsec scales. ...(2)",2019,"In Cycle 3, we observed the central few parsecs of the active nucleus of NGC~1068 and discovered a high-velocity (+/- 400 km/s) outflow in the molecular tracers CO 6-5 (80~mas beam) and HCN 4-3 (150 mas beam). The observations essentially rule out the classic ""donut"" paradigm for the medium that obscures our sight-line to the broad line region. Rather, the geometry appears to be more of a bipolar outflow resembling the molecular outflows of protostars. However, the outflow is only marginally resolved, making it impossible to discern the dynamical nature of the outflow. We therefore propose to observe the outflow at the best angular resolution afforded by ALMA, 20~mas (1.4 pc), in the CO 2-1 and HCN 3-2 lines. The proposed observations will provide the best possible constraints on the kinematics of the outflow, and in addition will afford the best constraints on the conditions in the near-AGN molecular gas on parsec scales.",NGC1068_a_06_TM1,"Marconi, Alessandro; O'Dea, Christopher; Impellizzeri, Violette; Lutz, Dieter; Baum, Stefi; Elitzur, Moshe; Maiolino, Roberto;",0.4297598550893632,0.01365330600356679,1.6992621,uid://A001/X1296/X3b3,uid://A001/X1296/X3b4,uid://A002/Xc5802b/X6aad,Mapping the Molecular Outflow of NGC1068,S,TARGET,T,0.43974614790548994,T,2019ApJ...884L..28I 2020ApJ...902...99I 2023MNRAS.519...34H 2023PASJ...75..874M,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)/Quasars (QSO), Outflows, jets, feedback",Active galaxies,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Gallimore, Jack",,jgallimo

When a single metallicity is used for all the star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in 'catastrophic' errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10-20 per cent of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of 10 or more. In this paper, we present a pilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from the PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old globular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colours, and then reassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find that young 'Interlopers' can be identified from their Hα flux. CO (2-1) intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at the ≈15 per cent level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from between 13 and 21 per cent, to between 3 and 8 per cent). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem, where very dusty young clusters with E(B - V) &gt; 1.5 mag are assigned old, globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense population of ≈300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365 and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy. Context. The final stages of molecular cloud evolution involve cloud disruption due to feedback by massive stars, with recent literature suggesting the importance of early (i.e., pre-supernova) feedback mechanisms. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine whether feedback from massive stars in H II regions has a measurable impact on the physical properties of molecular clouds at a characteristic scale of ~ 100 pc, and whether the imprint of feedback on the molecular gas depends on the local galactic environment. <BR /> Methods: We identified giant molecular clouds (GMCs) associated with H II regions for a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from catalogs of GMCs and H II regions released by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE surveys, using the overlap of the CO and Hα emission as the key criterion for physical association. We compared the distributions of GMC and H II region properties for paired and non-paired objects. We investigated correlations between GMC and H II region properties among galaxies and across different galactic environments to determine whether GMCs that are associated with H II regions have significantly distinct physical properties compared to the parent GMC population. <BR /> Results: We identify trends between the Hα luminosity of an H II region and the CO peak brightness and molecular mass of GMCs that we tentatively attribute to a direct physical connection between the matched objects, and which arise independently of the underlying environmental variations of GMC and H II region properties within galaxies. The study of the full sample nevertheless hides a large galaxy-to-galaxy variability. <BR /> Conclusions: At the ~100 pc scales accessed by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE data, pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in H II regions have a subtle but measurable impact on the properties of the surrounding molecular gas, as inferred from CO observations. ...(11)",2021,"NGC 1068 is the prototype of Seyfert 2 galaxies and one of the best-studied galaxies in the local Universe. High-resolution ALMA mapping of the central kpc has revealed strong AGN feedback effects, including a molecular gas outflow out to R~400pc. However, optical observations clearly demonstrate that AGN feedback extends further out, with two prominent ionisation cones that graze the disc and reach scales of 10 kpc. We propose to map CO(2-1) at 5.7"" ~ 400pc resolution across the disc of NGC 1068 to measure the large-scale impact of the AGN. We will study whether molecular gas properties change inside the ionisation cones with respect to the rest of the disc and relative to other non-active galaxies.

The final stages of molecular cloud evolution involve cloud disruption due to feedback by massive stars, with recent literature suggesting the importance of early (i.e., pre-supernova) feedback mechanisms. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine whether feedback from massive stars in H II regions has a measurable impact on the physical properties of molecular clouds at a characteristic scale of ~ 100 pc, and whether the imprint of feedback on the molecular gas depends on the local galactic environment. <BR /> Methods: We identified giant molecular clouds (GMCs) associated with H II regions for a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from catalogs of GMCs and H II regions released by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE surveys, using the overlap of the CO and Hα emission as the key criterion for physical association. We compared the distributions of GMC and H II region properties for paired and non-paired objects. We investigated correlations between GMC and H II region properties among galaxies and across different galactic environments to determine whether GMCs that are associated with H II regions have significantly distinct physical properties compared to the parent GMC population. <BR /> Results: We identify trends between the Hα luminosity of an H II region and the CO peak brightness and molecular mass of GMCs that we tentatively attribute to a direct physical connection between the matched objects, and which arise independently of the underlying environmental variations of GMC and H II region properties within galaxies.

When a single metallicity is used for all the star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in 'catastrophic' errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10-20 per cent of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of 10 or more. In this paper, we present a pilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from the PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old globular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colours, and then reassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find that young 'Interlopers' can be identified from their Hα flux. CO (2-1) intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at the ≈15 per cent level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from between 13 and 21 per cent, to between 3 and 8 per cent). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem, where very dusty young clusters with E(B - V) &gt; 1.5 mag are assigned old, globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense population of ≈300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365 and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy. Context.

When a single metallicity is used for all the star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in 'catastrophic' errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10-20 per cent of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of 10 or more. In this paper, we present a pilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from the PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old globular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colours, and then reassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find that young 'Interlopers' can be identified from their Hα flux. CO (2-1) intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at the ≈15 per cent level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from between 13 and 21 per cent, to between 3 and 8 per cent). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem, where very dusty young clusters with E(B - V) &gt; 1.5 mag are assigned old, globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense population of ≈300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365 and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy. Context. The final stages of molecular cloud evolution involve cloud disruption due to feedback by massive stars, with recent literature suggesting the importance of early (i.e., pre-supernova) feedback mechanisms. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine whether feedback from massive stars in H II regions has a measurable impact on the physical properties of molecular clouds at a characteristic scale of ~ 100 pc, and whether the imprint of feedback on the molecular gas depends on the local galactic environment. <BR /> Methods: We identified giant molecular clouds (GMCs) associated with H II regions for a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from catalogs of GMCs and H II regions released by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE surveys, using the overlap of the CO and Hα emission as the key criterion for physical association. We compared the distributions of GMC and H II region properties for paired and non-paired objects. We investigated correlations between GMC and H II region properties among galaxies and across different galactic environments to determine whether GMCs that are associated with H II regions have significantly distinct physical properties compared to the parent GMC population. <BR /> Results: We identify trends between the Hα luminosity of an H II region and the CO peak brightness and molecular mass of GMCs that we tentatively attribute to a direct physical connection between the matched objects, and which arise independently of the underlying environmental variations of GMC and H II region properties within galaxies. The study of the full sample nevertheless hides a large galaxy-to-galaxy variability. <BR /> Conclusions: At the ~100 pc scales accessed by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE data, pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in H II regions have a subtle but measurable impact on the properties of the surrounding molecular gas, as inferred from CO observations. ...(11)",2021,"NGC 1068 is the prototype of Seyfert 2 galaxies and one of the best-studied galaxies in the local Universe.

We find that young 'Interlopers' can be identified from their Hα flux. CO (2-1) intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at the ≈15 per cent level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from between 13 and 21 per cent, to between 3 and 8 per cent). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem, where very dusty young clusters with E(B - V) &gt; 1.5 mag are assigned old, globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense population of ≈300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365 and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy. Context. The final stages of molecular cloud evolution involve cloud disruption due to feedback by massive stars, with recent literature suggesting the importance of early (i.e., pre-supernova) feedback mechanisms. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine whether feedback from massive stars in H II regions has a measurable impact on the physical properties of molecular clouds at a characteristic scale of ~ 100 pc, and whether the imprint of feedback on the molecular gas depends on the local galactic environment. <BR /> Methods: We identified giant molecular clouds (GMCs) associated with H II regions for a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from catalogs of GMCs and H II regions released by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE surveys, using the overlap of the CO and Hα emission as the key criterion for physical association. We compared the distributions of GMC and H II region properties for paired and non-paired objects. We investigated correlations between GMC and H II region properties among galaxies and across different galactic environments to determine whether GMCs that are associated with H II regions have significantly distinct physical properties compared to the parent GMC population. <BR /> Results: We identify trends between the Hα luminosity of an H II region and the CO peak brightness and molecular mass of GMCs that we tentatively attribute to a direct physical connection between the matched objects, and which arise independently of the underlying environmental variations of GMC and H II region properties within galaxies. The study of the full sample nevertheless hides a large galaxy-to-galaxy variability. <BR /> Conclusions: At the ~100 pc scales accessed by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE data, pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in H II regions have a subtle but measurable impact on the properties of the surrounding molecular gas, as inferred from CO observations. ...(11)",2021,"NGC 1068 is the prototype of Seyfert 2 galaxies and one of the best-studied galaxies in the local Universe.

When a single metallicity is used for all the star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in 'catastrophic' errors for old globular clusters.

The study of the full sample nevertheless hides a large galaxy-to-galaxy variability. <BR /> Conclusions: At the ~100 pc scales accessed by the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE data, pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in H II regions have a subtle but measurable impact on the properties of the surrounding molecular gas, as inferred from CO observations. ...(11)",2021,"NGC 1068 is the prototype of Seyfert 2 galaxies and one of the best-studied galaxies in the local Universe. High-resolution ALMA mapping of the central kpc has revealed strong AGN feedback effects, including a molecular gas outflow out to R~400pc. However, optical observations clearly demonstrate that AGN feedback extends further out, with two prominent ionisation cones that graze the disc and reach scales of 10 kpc. We propose to map CO(2-1) at 5.7"" ~ 400pc resolution across the disc of NGC 1068 to measure the large-scale impact of the AGN. We will study whether molecular gas properties change inside the ionisation cones with respect to the rest of the disc and relative to other non-active galaxies. Combining with existing sub-arcsecond ALMA data, we will construct a high-resolution cube of the central area which is sensitive to all spatial scales, bridging the gap between AGN effects in the nuclear region and surroundings.",NGC1068_a_06_TP,"Garcia-Burillo, Santiago; Ho, I-TIng; Saito, Toshiki; Utomo, Dyas; Groves, Brent; Kruijssen, Diederik; Chevance, Melanie; Usero, Antonio; Schruba, Andreas; García-Rodríguez, Axel; Leroy, Adam; Glover, Simon; Schinnerer, Eva; Sanchez-Garcia, Maria; Emsellem, Eric;",7.022909114888186,0.27947597010185166,1.1145267,uid://A001/X14c3/X1239,uid://A001/X14c3/X123c,uid://A002/Xe539c7/X4903,Assessing the impact of AGN feedback in the prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068,S,TARGET,T,412.4061462537799,T,2021ApJS..257...43L 2022ApJ...927..149L 2022ApJ...938...87K 2022ApJ...941...92H 2022MNRAS.509.1303W 2022MNRAS.512.1522D 2022MNRAS.512.4736S 2023A&A...678A.171Z 2023ApJ...944..110M 2023ApJ...944L..10L 2023MNRAS.519.1068L 2023MNRAS.520...63W 2024ApJS..271....2H,"Outflows, jets, feedback, Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) properties",Active galaxies,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502,"Querejeta, Miguel",,querejeta

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(7)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models. Based on prior near infrared line detections, we confidently expect expect detectios of the line emission in both SgrA* and NGC 1068.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(7)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(7)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained.

We also develop a physical basis and empirical calibration (with 72 low-z and z ˜ 2 galaxies) for using the dust continuum as a quantitative probe of ISM masses. The galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) at &#60; z&#62; = 2.2 and 4.4 have gas masses up to 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50%-80%, i.e., gas masses 1-4× their stellar masses. We find a single high-z star formation law: {SFR}=35 {M}{mol}0.89× {(1+z)}z=20.95× {({sSFR})}{MS}0.23 {M}⊙ yr-1—an approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z &#62; 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ˜2-5 times shorter gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates. ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate the interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to 4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ({M}* ) from the optical–infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, {M}* , and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately with the 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFRMS. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolution and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function, we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution (&#62; 100 {M}ȯ yr‑1 at z &#62; 2.5). Simple power-law dependencies are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and active galactic nucleus activity at early epochs. ...(7)",2016,"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) of starforming and AGN sources cannot be probed directly from the ground or from space; their EUV are thus very poorly constrained. Our recent theoretical work demonstrates that the mm/submm recombination lines of HI and HeII are excellent probes of the EUV: they have little dust absorption, they arise from H and He (thus independent of metallicity) and their fluxes depend linearly on number of EUV continuum photons. The He++ region (producing HeII emission) requires 54 ev photons, thus the EUV hardness is directly proportional to the HeII/HI flux ratio. We propose observations of HI and HeII in compact OB star regions and galactic nuclei (SgrA* and NGC 1068). These observations will demonstrate the potential of the HI and HeII lines -- opening a new observing window on the EUV. Themeasured hardness of the EUV spectra will provide critical input to starburstsynthesis models. Based on prior near infrared line detections, we confidently expect expect detectios of the line emission in both SgrA* and NGC 1068.
